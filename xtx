Subject: Clarification on Missing pingone.protect.template.header in PingAccess Risk Policy
Description of the Issue:
We have PingAccess Risk Policy enabled for an application, and while logins are generally successful, we observe intermittent unsuccessful login attempts. Upon investigating the logs, we see the following error appearing multiple times:

vbnet
Copy code
com.pingidentity.pa.localization.LocalizedMessageResolverImpl - Unable to find message with key "pingone.protect.template.header"
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key pingone.protect.template.header
From previous versions of PingAccess, we noticed that these keys were present in pa-messages.properties but without any assigned value, such as:

pgsql
Copy code
pingone.protect.template.title=
pingone.protect.template.header=
However, in our current deployment, we do not see these keys at all in pa-messages.properties.

Questions for Ping Support:
Is the pingone.protect.template.header key required in pa-messages.properties even if it has no value?
Could the missing key cause risk evaluation interruptions or failed login attempts?
What specific functionality does this key control? Is it related to the UI loading page for device profiling?
If this key is required, what value should be assigned to it?
Are there any recent updates or best practices regarding the handling of localization keys in PingAccess for Risk Evaluation?
If we manually add the key with an empty value (pingone.protect.template.header=), will this resolve the error, or do we need to provide a valid value?
Additional Information:
PingAccess Version: [Your Version]
PingOne Protect Integration: Enabled for risk evaluation
Risk Policy Location: Configured in PingAccess, not PingFederate
Device Profiling Method: Captured by PingAccess
Intermittent Issue: The error appears multiple times for some login attempts, leading to sporadic login failures
Observed in Logs: Appears in pingaccess-engine logs
Steps Taken So Far:
Checked pa-messages.properties (found that the key is missing)
Compared with previous versions where the key existed without a value
Verified that login failures align with the occurrence of this error
Confirmed that some logins are successful despite the error, but others fail intermittently
Could you please clarify whether this key is mandatory, whether it affects risk evaluation, and what the correct approach would be to resolve this?
