<h1>ConsentApplication - Requirements for Lender Consent Delegation</h1>

<hr>

<h2>1. UI Updates for System ID Delegation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Add verbiage in the UI</strong> informing lenders that when they consent to a <strong>system ID</strong>, the consent applies to <strong>all of the TSPâ€™s products (current and future)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure visibility</strong> of this information at the <strong>time of consent selection</strong> to avoid confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal review required</strong> to validate the UI messaging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. UI Updates for User ID Delegation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When a <strong>lender delegates a user ID</strong>, the ConsentApplication UI should <strong>display a list of TSP software products</strong> available for delegation.</li>
    <li>The lender should be able to <strong>select multiple TSP products</strong> to grant access.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure UI clarity</strong> on the fact that previously delegated user IDs may already have access to certain APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. System ID Consent Automation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When a lender <strong>consents to a system ID</strong>, ensure it is <strong>automatically delegated</strong> to <strong>all relevant TSP products</strong> without requiring separate consent actions.</li>
    <li>Update API logic to handle <strong>automatic system ID delegation</strong> when a lender provides consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Handling API Overlaps Between TSPs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that when <strong>multiple TSPs share the same API roles</strong>, lenders <strong>do not need to provide duplicate consents</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add logic in the ConsentApplication to <strong>check for existing API roles</strong> before requesting additional consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Audit & Tracking</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Implement a <strong>tracking mechanism</strong> to log <strong>when a lender consents to a system ID or user ID</strong> and which TSP products were included.</li>
    <li>Ensure <strong>logs capture delegation events</strong> for auditing and compliance purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Pending Legal Review</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Legal team</strong> must <strong>review and approve the UI messaging</strong> related to consent delegation.</li>
    <li>Finalize whether <strong>explicit consent</strong> is required if a lender already has access to an API via another TSP.</li>
</ul>
